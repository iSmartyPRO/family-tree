# Notifications, push and the scheduler

## Notification center

Every module notifies through one service (`src/backend/services/notifications.js`):

```js
await notify({
  userIds: [recipientId],
  kind: 'files.shared',
  module: 'files',
  link: '/app/files/n/42',
  actorId: req.user.id,                 // never notified about their own action
  render: (locale) => ({ title, body }), // text in the recipient's language
});
```

- **In-app (always):**
  - stored in `notifications`;
  - the bell in the top bar shows an unread counter (polled every 45 s and on focus) and a panel with All / Unread, mark-all-read and links;
  - kept 120 days.
- **External channels:** delivered after the request finishes, so a slow mail server never delays the user.

  | Channel | Reaches the user when |
  |---------|-----------------------|
  | **Push** | They enabled *Push on this device* (installed app, see [pwa.md](pwa.md)) |
  | **Email** | SMTP or the Gmail sender is configured and the profile has an email |
  | **Telegram** | The bot is configured and Telegram is linked |
  | **WhatsApp** | WhatsApp sending is configured (gateway or Wazzup, the provider and fallback chosen in *Sign-in methods*) and the profile has a valid mobile phone |
  | **Mattermost** | Mattermost is configured and the profile has a Mattermost username |

- **Preferences** (*Profile → Notifications*, stored in `users.notify_prefs`):
  - **channels**: a master switch per channel; each card shows *On / Off / Not connected / Unavailable* and how to fix it. *Send a test* delivers a test through every connected channel at once and shows the result per channel (including the error text);
  - **events × channels**: a table of every kind of notification (from `services/notificationCatalog.js`) against the bell and each channel, with presets *Recommended*, *Only important*, *Everything everywhere*, *Bell only*. Unticking the bell column drops the event entirely;
  - **quiet hours** (e.g. 22:00–08:00, optionally all weekend) and **pause** (1 h, 3 h, until tomorrow, until Monday): push, e-mail and messengers wait: held channels are queued (`notification_deferred`) and sent when the window ends, unless the notification was read in the bell by then (after 7 days or 10 re-holds they expire); the bell still collects everything. Computed in the person's time zone (saved from the browser);
  - **messengers** (Telegram, WhatsApp, Mattermost) share one default per event and can be switched separately; a reminder sent *to messengers* goes to all three;
  - **urgent** kinds — reminders the person or a colleague set (flag `urgent` in the catalog; among the shipped kinds only the hidden `system.test`) — ignore quiet hours and the pause and cannot be muted per event; the reminder itself chooses its channels;
  - **subscriptions**: a module can let people follow a record (🔔 → notices about its changes, e.g. a hypothetical `orders.order`). The storage and API are in place; `canFollow()` in `routes/account.routes.js` decides per type and currently allows nothing, so a module that offers following adds its type and access check there. Followers are checked against their current access each time;
  - **delivery history**: every notification stores where it went (`notifications.delivery`: `sent`, `failed: …`, `off`, `unreachable`, `deferred`, `expired`, `skipped`; older rows may show `quiet` / `paused`); the last ones are listed with a mark per channel.
- **Delivery** runs in batches of ten recipients so a notification to a large group never exhausts the database pool or opens hundreds of SMTP sessions.
- **Email:** an HTML template with the product name and an *Open* button, plus a plain-text part. Links use `PUBLIC_URL` / `FRONTEND_URL`.
- **App badge:** the unread count shows on the app icon (Badging API), from the page and from push messages.

### Administration (Settings → Integrations → Notifications)

- **Channels for notifications**: each channel works when its integration is set up *and* it is switched on here (`settings.notify_config`). Each card shows how many active people the channel can reach (who has an e-mail, a phone, linked Telegram, a Mattermost name, push turned on).
- **WhatsApp for notifications**: *as for sign-in codes* (follows *Sign-in methods*), *WhatsApp gateway* or *Wazzup*, with an optional fallback to the other provider — so codes and notifications can use different providers.
- **Contacts on several accounts**: a phone, e-mail, Mattermost or Instagram name shared by two or more accounts is listed with links to them. While shared, a code sign-in to it fails for all of them (lookups refuse an ambiguous match) and their notifications reach one person. New duplicates are refused: creating or editing a user with a contact another account has returns `409 CONTACT_TAKEN` (`info.field`, plus `info.username` for administrators); directory sign-in (AD) does not copy an e-mail another account already uses. Telegram is unique by index.
- **Test message** to any phone, e-mail, Telegram chat id or Mattermost user, with the provider's answer.
- People connect a missing channel in place: in *Profile → Notifications* and under a reminder's channel choice they type their phone (WhatsApp), Mattermost name or e-mail, save it and get a test at once. Only channels the portal offers are suggested; Telegram links to the official button in *Profile → Security*.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET / PUT | `/api/admin/notifications` | Settings, integration state, providers, coverage / `{ channels: {…}, whatsapp: { provider: auto\|gateway\|wazzup, fallback } }` (`settings.integrations`) |
| POST | `/api/admin/notifications/test` | `{ channel, to, provider? }` → `{ ok, via \| error, ms }` |

### API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/notifications?limit&before&unread=1` | Inbox page, unread count |
| GET | `/api/notifications/unread` | Counter only |
| POST | `/api/notifications/read` | `{ ids: [] }` or `{ all: true }` |
| GET / PUT | `/api/account/notifications` | Preferences, reachability, configured channels and the event catalog. `PUT` takes `{ channels, events: { kind: { inbox, push, … } }, resetEvents, quiet: { enabled, from, to, weekends }, pausedUntil, tz }` |
| POST | `/api/account/notifications/test` | `{ channel? }` — a test through every connected channel (or one) → per-channel report |
| GET | `/api/account/notifications/history` | Last notifications with their delivery report |
| GET / PUT | `/api/account/notifications/subscriptions` | Followed records / `{ type: '<module>.<record>', id, on }` (only things the person can see; see *subscriptions* above) |

A module adding a notification kind lists it in `services/notificationCatalog.js` (group, default channels, `urgent`, `channels` it can use) and adds `events.<kind>` texts to `locales/<lang>/notifyPrefs.js`; the server-side message goes to `src/backend/locales/<lang>/<module>.js` (see [i18n.md](i18n.md#server-texts)).

## Web Push

- **Standard:** Web Push with VAPID (`web-push`).
- **Keys:** generated on first use and stored in `app_settings.webpush`. The private key is sealed (see below).
- **Allowed endpoints:** only real push services are accepted: FCM, Mozilla, Apple, Windows, on the standard HTTPS port. This rules out using subscriptions to make the server call internal hosts.
- **Sign-out:** the device unsubscribes and the app badge is cleared, so a shared device does not keep receiving the previous person's notifications.
- **Subscriptions:** one per device in `push_subscriptions`. Those the push service reports as gone (404/410), or rejects because they were made for other VAPID keys (403 key mismatch), are deleted automatically.
- **Re-subscribing:** a few seconds after the app starts, a device that already allowed notifications compares its subscription's key with `/api/pwa/vapid`; if the key changed it re-subscribes with the new key. No permission prompt is shown — the permission is already granted.
- **Payload:** title, body, link, tag and the unread count. The service worker shows the notification, updates the badge and opens the link on tap.
- **iPhone / iPad:** iOS 16.4+, and only in the app added to the home screen.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/pwa/vapid` | Public key |
| GET / POST / DELETE | `/api/pwa/push` | Device count / subscribe `{ subscription }` / unsubscribe `{ endpoint }` |
| POST | `/api/pwa/push/test` | Test notification to all my devices |

## Scheduler

`services/scheduler.js` runs registered jobs on a timer (20-second tick):
- each job runs inside a **Postgres advisory lock**, so several app instances never run the same job twice;
- failures are logged, never thrown;
- `DISABLE_SCHEDULER=true` turns it off, e.g. for a worker-less replica.

```js
registerJob({ name: 'orders:reminders', everyMs: 5 * 60 * 1000, run: runReminders });
```

| Job | Interval |
|-----|----------|
| `notifications:deferred` | 1 min — releases notifications held by quiet hours or a pause |
| `notifications:retention` | 6 h |
| `sessions:purge` | 6 h |
| `api:webhooks` | 20 s — webhook deliveries and retries |
| `api:housekeeping` | 6 h |
| `files:trash` | 6 h |
| `files:link-notices` | 1 min |
| `storage:previews` | 24 h |
| `office:locks` | 15 min |

## Sealed secrets

`services/crypto.js` stores credentials kept on behalf of users with AES-256-GCM:
- Google refresh tokens;
- the Gmail sender token;
- the VAPID private key.

- webhook signing secrets.

The key is `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, or one derived from `JWT_SECRET` when that is not set. To change either without losing these values, list the old one in `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS` / `JWT_SECRET_PREVIOUS` — see [security.md → Rotating secrets](security.md#rotating-secrets). Values opened with an old key are re-sealed with the new one.

If the VAPID private key can be opened with no known key, new VAPID keys are generated, every stored device subscription is dropped (they belong to the old key), and administrators get a *Stored secret cannot be decrypted* security event. Devices that already allowed notifications re-subscribe silently on their next visit. An unreadable Google token is **not** treated as revoked: the connection is kept and calls fail with `GOOGLE_KEY` until the old key is restored or the person reconnects.

## Tour

- Tour `notifications` (`tour/content/notifications.js`, texts `tour.notifications.*` in `locales/<lang>/tour.js`) of Account → Notifications: the bell, channels, «Проверить», quiet hours, the event × channel matrix, subscriptions, history. Started from the page's «Тур» button (it is not a module, so it never starts on its own). Anchors: `header.notifications`, `np.channels`, `np.test`, `np.quiet`, `np.events`, `np.subs`, `np.history`.
