# Security

This document is the go-live guide for the skeleton. Report vulnerabilities per [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Threat model (short)

| Asset | Risk if exposed |
|-------|-----------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Forge sessions |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `DATABASE_URL` | Read/write all app data |
| Integration tokens in `app_settings` | Mail/Telegram/WhatsApp/AD takeover |
| Unfinished `/setup` | Stranger becomes first admin |
| Upload directory | Stored XSS if SVG/HTML were served executable |
| Session cookie | Account takeover if XSS can read it — cookie is httpOnly, so XSS must call APIs as the user |

Assumptions:

- The number of reverse proxies in front of Express matches `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` (the bundled nginx is one).
- Postgres is not on the public internet.
- You finish setup before advertising the URL, or you set `SETUP_TOKEN`.

## Controls already in the code

**Authentication**

- Passwords: bcrypt cost 12, dummy hash on unknown users (harder user enumeration by timing).
- Failed logins: same error text for bad password, disabled, and blocked accounts at the HTTP layer; events still distinguish kinds for admins.
- Lockout: separate streaks per **username** and per **IP**.
- Login limiter: 20 / 15 min / IP, plus global `/api` limiter.
- Password change increments `token_version` (other sessions die).
- Cookie: httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure when `FRONTEND_URL` is `https://`, `X-Forwarded-Proto` is https, or `COOKIE_SECURE=true`. The bundled nginx passes on an outer proxy's `X-Forwarded-Proto` (http/https only) and otherwise sends its own scheme; the app trusts the header from loopback only.
- Changing one's password in the cabinet: wrong current passwords count towards the same per-username lockout as sign-in (`429 LOCKED`).

**Authorization** (full model: [access-control.md](access-control.md))

- Every admin route requires `console.access` plus its own permission; settings patches are checked per key.
- You can only grant roles and groups whose permissions you hold; users with more access than you are read-only to you.
- The last active super administrator cannot be removed by any path — changes run in a transaction and roll back with `409 LAST_SUPERADMIN`.
- Administrators cannot demote, disable, block or delete their own account.
- Role change, disabling, blocking and password reset bump `token_version` — the user is signed out everywhere.
- Sessions: the cookie is a JWT whose `sid` claim names a row in `user_sessions` (device user agent, first and last IP, `X-Client-Mode` pwa/browser, sign-in method, `impersonated_by`, expiry). A cookie only works while its row exists, is not revoked and has not expired; last activity is written at most once a minute per session. Rows ended or expired more than 30 days ago are purged by the `sessions:purge` job; a revoked `legacy` row is kept until its token expires (it is what keeps that token out).
- Users see their sessions in Account → Security (`GET /api/account/sessions`) and end one (`DELETE /api/account/sessions/:id`) or all others (`POST /api/account/sessions/revoke-others`, which also bumps `token_version` and re-issues the current cookie with the same `sid`). Administrators with `users.manage` see and end a user's sessions (`GET`/`DELETE /api/admin/users/:id/sessions[/:sid]`, `POST /api/admin/users/:id/revoke-sessions`). None of this is available while signed in as another user or to API tokens.
- Sign out ends the current row. "Sign in as" sessions are listed for the person with the administrator's name and end on "Return to my account"; they also end with the administrator's own sessions and stop working once the administrator is blocked, disabled or no longer a superadministrator (see [access-control.md](access-control.md#sign-in-as-a-user)).
- Cookies issued before sessions existed (no `sid`) keep working until they expire; on their first request they get a row (method `legacy`, id derived from the token hash) so they appear in the list and can be ended. The older `revoked_sessions` list is still honoured for them.

**Sign-in methods**

- Active Directory: service bind + escaped search + user bind; empty passwords are rejected (no anonymous bind).
- Telegram Login: HMAC-SHA256 signature with the bot token, payload younger than 24 h; redirect mode, so no `unsafe-eval` in the CSP.
- One-time codes: 6 digits, 5 minutes, single use, 5 attempts, HMAC-hashed, resend limits, identical responses for known and unknown accounts.
- Magic links: 256-bit tokens, SHA-256 hashed, 15 minutes, single use, delivered in the URL fragment.
- Break-glass: super administrators can always use their password.

**Setup**

- Write routes return `403` after an admin exists.
- Once setup finishes, `SETUP_LOCKED=true` is written to `.env`; the wizard stays closed even if PostgreSQL is unreachable (otherwise an outage would let anyone repoint the database).
- Optional `SETUP_TOKEN` (timing-safe compare). Without a valid token, status does not leak DB host/user.
- Setup limiter on write endpoints: 20 / 15 min. `GET /api/setup/status` is not throttled because the SPA reads it on every page load.

**Network**

- CORS origin is `FRONTEND_URL` with credentials (not `*`).
- IP allow/block lists; CIDR bits must be 0–32.
- Localhost is always allowed (so you cannot lock yourself out from the host). IPv4 CIDR only for ranges; IPv6 exact match.
- Security changes, new block rules and rule deletions that would deny the acting admin's own IP are rejected with `409 SELF_LOCKOUT`.
- Settings and IP rules are cached for 5 s, so per-request checks do not depend on a database round-trip.

**Uploads**

- Random filenames, size caps (1 MB avatar, 2 MB logo).
- Magic-byte check; SVG logos reject `<script`, `on*=`, `javascript:`.
- `/uploads/` CSP `default-src 'none'` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

**Data**

- Public settings hide integration secrets.
- Admin settings return `*Set` flags instead of secret values.
- SQL is parameterized.
- JSON body limit 1 MB.

**HTTP**

- Helmet (API). Frontend CSP is in `nginx.conf`.
- `server_tokens off`, frame and referrer policies.

## Hardening you must do in production

1. **TLS** in front of the container. Set `FRONTEND_URL=https://your.domain`.
2. **`JWT_SECRET`** ≥ 32 random bytes. Production **exits** if it is empty.
3. **`SETUP_TOKEN`**: `make env` / `make secrets` generate one until setup is locked and print it — enter it in the `/setup` wizard. Remove or rotate it after go-live (writes already 403).
4. **Do not publish Postgres** on `0.0.0.0:5432` without a firewall.
5. **Closed access** unless the landing must be public.
6. **Allow-list** if only office IPs should reach the app. Add your IPv4/CIDR first (*Allow my IP* in Settings → IP filtering); the API refuses to enable it otherwise.
7. **Rotate** DB password and JWT if they ever appeared in chat, tickets, or screenshots — keep the old JWT secret for decryption as described in [Rotating secrets](#rotating-secrets), or stored tokens and webhook secrets stop opening.
8. **Backups** of Postgres + `data/uploads/`.
9. **Proxy count**: set `TRUST_PROXY_HOPS` to the number of proxies in front of Express (bundled nginx + any outer proxy). Too low and every client shares the proxy IP (lockouts hit everyone); too high and clients can spoof `X-Forwarded-For`.
10. Run **`make env`** on every new deploy; never copy a production `.env` into git.

## Known limits (accept or extend)

| Topic | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| CSRF | Mitigated by SameSite=Lax + no cookie auth on cross-site POST from typical attackers. Do not add state-changing GET. |
| Helmet CSP | Disabled on Express (JSON API). nginx CSP covers the SPA. |
| Public links that accept changes | Files links can allow anonymous upload / rename / replace / delete ([files.md](files.md#link-permissions)). Writes run as the link's author inside the link's subtree only, need a visitor session token (scope `w`) in `X-Link-Token` (bound to the link version: password change or revoke ends every session), pass the Origin check and per-link rate limits (keyed by the link id, so letter-case variants of a slug share them), and keep deletes and replaced versions in the owner's trash. File URLs (`?t=`) carry only a read token (scope `r`), which can neither change anything nor open a session, so tokens in browser history or access logs (nginx masks `t=` anyway) are read-only. Links without their own quota take the module's default upload limit per link (Files). An upload-only visitor whose file is stored as `Name (2)` is still answered and shown the name they sent, so a drop box does not reveal what it holds. Refusals before a link opens (password, employees only) carry no name or kind. Admins can switch such links off or require a password for them. |
| SVG logos | Best-effort sanitization, not a full SVG sanitizer. Prefer PNG/WebP in hostile-admin scenarios. |
| IPv6 CIDR | Not implemented. |
| Username lockout | An attacker can lock a known username by failing logins (availability, not takeover). |
| Wizard window | Until an admin exists, setup is the most sensitive surface. The last step (access mode) only accepts the browser that created the administrator (a signed `da_setup` cookie, 1 h), a signed-in superadministrator or `SETUP_TOKEN` — a stranger cannot finish a half-done wizard. |
| Webhooks of stronger people | Rotating the secret, pinging, redelivering or removing a webhook needs every right of the person it runs as (like creating it); their delivery payloads and answers are hidden from weaker administrators. |
| API tokens and identities | Tokens can never link sign-in identities (Telegram, AD account, Google) or end sessions (`/admin/users/:id/{telegram,directory,google,sessions}` are blocked like `/account/*` credentials), so a leaked token cannot be turned into a browser session. |
| View-only public links | Without the download right, a link serves only what the browser shows inline (PDF, images, media, text) plus spreadsheets and Word files, which the viewers render from the original — for those «no download» is best effort. Anything else (archives, legacy Office, presentations) is shown through its PDF preview only. |
| Guessing public links | Anonymous file and preview requests through `/api/l/…` and `/api/s/…` count against the per-IP API limit (signed-in streams stay free), so link addresses cannot be probed without limit. New link passwords need at least 8 characters; tries are limited per address (IPv6 by /64) and link, plus 50 wrong tries per hour per link from everywhere; an expired link refuses password tries. |
| Container user | Only the nginx master runs as root (to bind :80); nginx workers run as `nginx` and the Node app as `node` (uid 1000, via `su-exec` in `start.sh`). On start the app's writable paths — `/app/uploads` and the mounted `/app/.env` — are handed to `node`, so on the host those files belong to uid 1000. Base images are pinned by digest in the Dockerfiles. |
| Secrets at rest | Integration secrets are stored in plaintext in `app_settings`. Restrict database access; encryption is on the roadmap. |
| Custom link addresses | Files (`/l/<slug>`) links may carry a readable address next to the random token. A readable address can be guessed, so the dialog suggests a password whenever a slug is set without one; links with sensitive content should keep the random address or a password. Availability checks are for signed-in people only and limited to 60 per minute per person (no bulk enumeration). Uniqueness is case-insensitive and enforced by a UNIQUE index on `LOWER(slug)` (parallel saves: one wins, the other gets `409 SLUG_TAKEN`). A slug stays with its link while the link exists — also revoked or expired — so a shared address never opens other content; after a slug change or deletion the old address stops at once and is held 90 days for its author only (`link_slug_holds`, written in the same transaction as the change, so the address is never free in between). Tokens are resolved before slugs and a new token never equals an existing slug. When an account is deleted, its Drive links are removed with it and their slugs become free at once (no hold); its Files links stay, inactive, and keep their slugs until someone deletes them. |
| Telegram Login | Requires `/setdomain` in @BotFather; users must link Telegram before signing in unless auto-provisioning is on. |
| Sign-in codes | Delivered by third parties (SMTP provider, Wazzup, Telegram). Their compromise exposes codes — keep codes short-lived (5 min) as shipped. |

## Password and username policy

- Password: 10–200 characters (length only — add complexity in a fork if policy requires it).
- Username: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{3,32}$`

## Secrets handling

| Secret | Store | API |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `JWT_SECRET` | `.env` | never |
| Postgres password | `.env` (wizard quotes special characters) | never |
| SMTP / Telegram / WhatsApp / AD | `app_settings` JSON | masked |
| Session JWT | httpOnly cookie | never in JSON |

`.env` is mounted writable so the wizard can persist DB settings. Restrict who can `docker exec` or read the host file.

### Rotating secrets

Some credentials are stored **encrypted** (AES-256-GCM) because the portal must use them later: Google refresh tokens (Calendar connection, Gmail sender), webhook signing secrets, the Web Push private key. The key is `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, or — when it is not set — derived from `JWT_SECRET`. So rotating `JWT_SECRET` on an install without `ENCRYPTION_KEY` also changes the encryption key.

Rotate without losing anything:

| You change | Also set (comma-separated lists are fine) |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `JWT_SECRET`, no `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `JWT_SECRET_PREVIOUS=<old JWT_SECRET>` |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS=<old ENCRYPTION_KEY>` |
| Introduce `ENCRYPTION_KEY` for the first time | nothing: values sealed with the JWT-derived key still open while `JWT_SECRET` is unchanged |

New values are always sealed with the current key; old ones are opened with any listed key and re-sealed with the current one when read (Google tokens, webhook secrets, the push key). Keep the `*_PREVIOUS` entries for a while (a few weeks covers people who rarely use their Google connection), then remove them.

Rotating `JWT_SECRET` signs everyone out (sessions are JWTs) — that is the point of rotating it.

If a value can be opened with **no** known key, nothing is deleted or treated as revoked:

- a **security event** *Stored secret cannot be decrypted* appears in *Activity* (and in Mattermost, as a danger event), at most once an hour per secret;
- **Google** Calendar / Gmail calls fail with `GOOGLE_KEY`; the connection and the Gmail sender stay configured — restore the old key, or reconnect;
- **webhooks** pause with *secret unreadable* (no failure counted, deliveries wait); *New secret* resumes them;
- **Web Push**: new keys are generated and old device subscriptions dropped; devices that already allowed notifications re-subscribe on their next visit without asking.
