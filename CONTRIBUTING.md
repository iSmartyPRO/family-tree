# Contributing

This repository is a **starter skeleton** for new products. Contributions that keep the base secure, small, and easy to fork are welcome.

## Development

```bash
make env
make dev
```

- UI: http://127.0.0.1:3020
- API: http://127.0.0.1:3021

Do not commit `.env`, uploads, or real credentials. Use `.env.example` only.

Before pushing:

```bash
make test        # backend unit tests + frontend production build
```

Database tests (`src/backend/test/*.db.test.js`) are skipped by `npm test`. Run them against a **test**
database only (never production), with the module flags set —
`grep -ho '[A-Z0-9_]*_DB_TEST=1' src/backend/test/*.js | sort -u` lists them — and one file at a time:

```bash
cd src/backend && I18N_DB_TEST=1 FILES_DB_TEST=1 … ENV_FILE_PATH=/path/to/test.env node --test --test-concurrency=1 test/*.test.js
```

`test/rbac-access.db.test.js` (read-only core checks) runs whenever any of these flags is set
(or its own `CORE_SECURITY_DB_TEST=1`), so every database run covers it.

How to add screens, endpoints, settings and integrations: [docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md).

## Commit messages and versions

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat(scope): …` for new features (minor), `fix(scope): …`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore` for the rest (patch), and `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for incompatible changes (major). `make release` / `make deploy` classify the commits since the last tag and bump the version everywhere — see [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md#version-and-releases).

## What to change vs. what to keep

| Keep as-is | Replace in a product fork |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Auth, sessions, IP lists, setup wizard | Branding, landing copy, color templates |
| `src/backend/middleware/*` | Domain pages and APIs for the real product |
| Cookie + CSRF assumptions (`SameSite=Lax`) | Footer link, `VERSION`, `DOCKER_NAME` |

See [docs/adapt.md](docs/adapt.md).

## Pull requests

- Prefer small, reviewable PRs.
- Security-sensitive changes (auth, uploads, setup, nginx) need a short threat note in the PR body.
- Match existing code style: ESM, parameterized SQL, no secrets in logs.
- New UI uses the shared kit (`PageHeader`, `SettingsSection`, `SaveBar`) and design tokens — no ad-hoc colors.
- Every user-facing string goes into both `en` and `ru` dictionaries.
- Add a line to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under *Unreleased*.
- Commit messages: Conventional Commits, imperative mood, ≤ 72-character subject (`feat(settings): add maintenance mode`).
