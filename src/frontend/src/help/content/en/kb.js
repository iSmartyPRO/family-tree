- The **tree** on the left shows every folder you can access (a slide-out panel on phones).
- **Breadcrumbs** on top take you one level up.
- **Grid** or **List** — pick the view you like.
- Every folder has a **Name**, **Description**, **Colour** and **Icon**. If you leave colour or icon unset, the “Default” from the module settings is used.

Folder actions are in the “Actions” menu: “Folder settings”, “Move”, “Access…”, “Public links…” and delete.`,

- **File** — any document: PDF, Word, Excel, slides, image, video. It opens in the browser.
- **Link** — the address of an external site (\`http\` or \`https\` only), e.g. the tax portal or a booking service.

Everything is added with the “Add” button: “Upload files”, “Add from Files”, “New article”, “New link”. A material can be edited, renamed, moved to another folder or deleted from its menu.`,

      body: `An article has two editors — the switch is above the text:

- **Visual** (the default for new articles) — like a regular document: headings, bold, italic, underline, highlight, lists, checklists, quotes, code, alignment, links and tables. **Pictures and files** can be pasted (Ctrl+V), dragged right into the text, uploaded from the computer or chosen from Files (the 🖼 and 📎 buttons). **Click a picture** to get its toolbar: size (S, M, L, 100% or “Auto” — the original), position relative to the text (centred, left, right, or **wrapped** left/right — the text flows beside the picture; on phones wrapped pictures take the full width), a caption, a description (alt text, for screen readers and search), a link, replace, open the original, download and delete. You can also drag a corner to resize; double-click adds a caption, Delete removes the picture. Readers click a picture to see it full screen. ⤢ opens the editor full screen, Esc returns.
- **Markdown** — plain text with marks and a toolbar. Three modes in the top right:

- **Text** — just the input;
- **Split** — text and result side by side;
- **Preview** — the article as readers see it.

If you know Markdown, type it directly: \`# Heading\`, \`**bold**\`, \`- list item\`.

A written article can be switched at any time: the content stays; going to Markdown drops only alignment and highlights; tables and pictures with a size, position or caption stay as HTML.`,

Files inserted in the text are attached automatically. Readers do not need access to these files in Files — access to the article is enough.`,

- **Images** — a gallery with zoom, pan and swipe (gestures on phones).
- **Word (.docx)** — rendered in the browser.
- **Excel and CSV** — a sheet grid with tabs (first 3,000 rows).
- **PowerPoint, legacy .doc / .xls, OpenDocument, RTF** — shown as PDF when the administrator has connected a conversion server.
