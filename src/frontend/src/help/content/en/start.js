      title: 'Signing in',
      body: `The sign-in page shows only the methods your administrator enabled. Most often:

- **Password** — username and password. If the company uses Active Directory, your usual work login and computer password will do.
- **Sign in with Google** — the button above the tabs, one click with your work Google account.
- **Telegram** — confirm the sign-in in Telegram without a password, or get a code from the portal bot.
- **Email**, **WhatsApp**, **Mattermost** — the portal sends a 6-digit code (or a sign-in link) to the contact in your profile.

A code is valid for 5 minutes and works once; a sign-in link — for 15 minutes. You are signed in as soon as you type the last digit. The portal remembers your method and opens the same tab next time.`,
      steps: [
        'Open the portal address in your browser.',
        'Pick the tab with your sign-in method (or press “Sign in with Google”).',

        'Type the 6 digits from the message — you are signed in automatically.',

        title: 'Forgot your password',

- **Dashboard** — your day at a glance: notifications, recent files and new knowledge base materials;
- another portal app, such as “Files” or “Knowledge base”;
- a start page with “Open account” and “Administration” buttons.

You can always get back home by clicking the logo and portal name in the top-left corner.`,

- **Flag** and **Theme** — switch the interface language (Russian/English) and light/dark theme;
- **?** — help for the current page;
- **Bell** — notifications; the number shows how many are unread;
- **Nine dots** — every portal app;
- **Four squares** — the administrator console (administrators only);

There are two ways to open an app:

- click the nine-dot icon in the header and pick the app from the grid;
- at the bottom of that grid click “All apps →” — the [Apps](/apps) page opens with tiles and a short description of each.`,

Elsewhere in the portal use the nine-dot icon to jump between apps, and the search inside each app (files, knowledge base).`,

      title: 'Language and theme',
      body: `The language and theme switches are in the header, to the left of the “?” icon. Changes apply at once.

To keep the choice in your account on every device, set it in [Account → Appearance](/account/appearance):

- **Language**: “As the portal”, “Русский” or “English”;
- **Theme**: “Light”, “Dark” or “System” — follows your phone or computer setting.`,

Step-by-step instructions with pictures for your device are on the [Install the app](/install) page. You can also open it from the menu under your avatar or from the sign-in page.

**What changes in the installed app:**

- there is no address bar and no browser buttons;
- so a **Back** button (an arrow) appears on the left of the header — it returns to the previous screen;
- the app icon shows the number of unread notifications;
- updates arrive on their own, nothing needs reinstalling.`,

The number on it is the unread count. The panel has “All” and “Unread” tabs and a “Mark all read” button; clicking a notification opens the file or folder. Notifications are kept for 120 days.

You can also receive them by email, Telegram, Mattermost and push — set this up in [Account → Notifications](/account/notifications). More in the [Notifications](/help/notifications) guide.`,

- **ⓘ next to a field** — hover or tap it for a short explanation and a “More” link to the right part of the guide;
- **the ? key** (or the **?** icon in the header) — opens help for the page you are on;
- **Help center** [/help](/help) — every guide, questions and answers, and a search across the help.

Each guide starts with a short “What you can do” and “Tips”, followed by detailed topics with examples and questions and answers.`,

1. **Reload the page** — F5 (⌘R on a Mac) or pull down on a phone. If you see “A new version is available”, press “Reload”.
2. **Sign out and back in** — the menu under your avatar → “Sign out”.
3. **Check your connection** — offline, the installed app shows a “no connection” screen.
4. **Try another browser** — an up-to-date Chrome, Edge, Safari or Yandex Browser.

If that does not help, contact the portal administrator or your company’s IT support. Describe what you did, what you expected and what you saw; attach a screenshot.`,
