- **Phone** — for WhatsApp sign-in codes, in international format. An invalid number is highlighted in red.
- **Mattermost** — your Mattermost username: the bot sends sign-in codes and notifications there.
- **Instagram** — optional.

Your **avatar** is changed with the “Change avatar” button at the top: JPG, PNG or WebP up to 1 MB. It is saved at once.

Other fields are saved with the **“Save”** button on the bar that appears at the bottom after your first change. “Discard” restores the previous values.`,

- **Theme** — the basic “Light”, “Dark”, “As the system” and ready-made themes: Graphite, Ocean, Forest, Sand, Midnight, Lavender, High contrast. Picking a card previews the portal in it until you press “Save”.

After “Save” the choice is kept in your account and applies on every device. The sun/moon switch in the header toggles light and dark in this browser only. Your administrator decides which themes are offered.`,

**Your own theme**: pick the “Custom” card, upload a picture (JPEG, PNG, WebP or GIF, up to 8 MB and 4096 × 4096 pixels) and an accent colour. The server compresses the picture and makes a phone version; only you can see it. The picture is dimmed under text (the “Dimming” slider) and panels stay solid.

- The **time zone** affects everything: the times shown on files and materials, when “today” and “tomorrow” begin, when quiet hours start.
- **As on this device** takes the zone from your phone or computer. Handy when travelling: times switch to local by themselves.
- Dates without a time (a birthday, for example) never shift when the zone changes.

**Sessions.** Where you are signed in right now: device, browser and system, whether the portal runs as the installed **app** or in a **browser tab**, IP address, sign-in method and last activity. The current one is marked “This device”. **“End”** signs one device out, **“End all except this one”** signs out all the others.
