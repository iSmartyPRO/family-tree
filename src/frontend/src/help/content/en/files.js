When you create one, choose who gets access:

- **Everyone can add and edit**: a common drive for the whole team;
- **Everyone can view**: only people you add can change files;
- **Only me**: add people later.

Change the rules later in the space menu → **Access**. Levels: **View** (open and download), **Edit** (upload, rename, move, delete), **Manage** (all of that plus access, links and the space’s trash).`,
