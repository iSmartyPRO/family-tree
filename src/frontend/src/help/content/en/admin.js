- **WhatsApp for notifications** — the provider: as for sign-in codes, only the WhatsApp gateway or only Wazzup, plus a fallback.
- **Test message** — to any number, e-mail, Telegram chat or Mattermost user, with the provider’s exact answer.

The integrations themselves (gateway address, Wazzup key, Telegram bot) are set up on their own pages under Integrations. What to receive is each person’s choice in Profile → Notifications, where they can also add a phone and get a test at once.`,

- **Active** — turn it off so the account cannot sign in at all (e.g. the person has left).
- **Blocked** — sign-in is refused even with the right password. Handy as a temporary measure, for example if you suspect the account was compromised.

**Password reset**: enter a new password and save — the person is signed out everywhere. The **Sessions** block shows where the person is signed in (device, browser or app, IP, sign-in method, activity, “sign in as” sessions): **“End”** signs out one device, **“Sign out everywhere”** ends them all at once without changing the password.

Any access change — groups, roles, status — also ends the user’s sessions, so they sign in again with the new rights.`,

One group is the **default**: new accounts join it when an administrator creates them without groups, or when they are created automatically on first sign-in through Active Directory, Google or Telegram. The default group cannot be deleted — make another group the default first.

With Active Directory, people can be added to portal groups automatically on sign-in — see “Sign-in methods”.`,

A **role** is a named set of permissions. It is given to a group (recommended) or directly to a person. A person’s effective permissions are the sum of all their roles, direct and via groups; you see them on the user page under **Effective access**.

Built-in roles:

- **Super administrator** — everything; cannot be edited or deleted.
- **Administrator** — users, groups, activity, branding, integrations.
- **Moderator** — helps users: profiles, password resets, blocking, activity.
- **Auditor** — read-only: users, activity, settings.
- **User** — personal cabinet only.

You can change the permissions of built-in roles — the changes survive upgrades. Your own roles can be created and deleted.`,

- **IP on block-list** and **IP not on allow-list** — IP filter denials.
- **Login rate limit** — too many attempts from one address.

- **Google** — a Google or Google Workspace account, optionally limited to company domains.
- **Active Directory / LDAP** — domain username and password. Accounts can be created automatically and directory groups mapped to portal groups.
- **Telegram Login** — one tap; the person links Telegram in their profile first.
- **One-time codes** — 6 digits via WhatsApp, email, Telegram or Mattermost. A code lives 5 minutes and allows 5 attempts.
